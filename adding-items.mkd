#Adding Items#

There are a multitude of differing methods for getting items into Zotero. Most advanced users of Zotero will use many, if not all of them. The different methods have different advantages and disadvantages and being aware of them will help users use them effectively. In rough order or priority, users can add items

1. using website translators via the Icon in the URL bar
2. by manually typing them
3. importing them from many bibliographic data formats (RIS, bibtex, MODS, etc.)
4. adding them using an "identifier," i.e. a number like ISBN, DOI, or PMID
5. adding PDF files and then retrieving the "metadata," i.e the citation information, online
6. adding a webpage with basic information from the browser. 


##Using Zotero Web Translators##

The principal way to add items into Zotero is from the web-browser, where users do most of their research. Whenever Zotero supports importing directly from a website, you will see a little icon at the right end of the URL bar (in Safari, the icon is to the left of the URL bar). The icon depends on the type of item Zotero identifies on the page. Most common are a lined sheet ![article icon](./screenshots/Ubuntu-ZF-3.0.11-icon-article.png) for journal articles, a blue book for book ![book icon](./screenshots/Ubuntu-ZF-3.0.11-icon-book) and a manila folder ![multiple icon](./screenshots/Ubuntu-ZF-3.0.11-icon-multiple.png). 

For single items (i.e. all icons except the manila folder), Zotero will then import the citation information for the item on the page. A grey pop-up ![translator bubble](./screenshots/Ubuntu-ZF-4.0.8-translator-bubble.png) at the bottom right of the screen will let you know that Zotero has successfully imported the item, in which collection (if any) the item is placed, and which attachments are  When you click the folder icon, Zotero will present you with a selection dialog with the title of all items it recognizes on the site - e.g. the search results of a catalog or the table of contents of a journal. 

![Translator Selection Dialog for Multiple Items](./screenshots/Ubuntu-ZF-3.0.11-multiple-dialog.png) 

Select all items you want to import and click OK (or press return) and Zotero will import all selected items, again informing you via the gray pop-up about the items it imports. 

###Automatic Tags and Attachments###
For most sites, Zotero will take a snapshot of the current site, or, in the case of newspapers or magazines, often of the single page or print view of an article. For most academic journals and article databases (such as EBSCO or JSTOR), Zotero will attempt to download and attach a copy of the full text of an article as a PDF. This will only work where a user has access to the fulltext PDF through her institution - either by logging in to a proxy while accessing the resource from off-campus or by IP recognition on campus. *PDF attachment for proxied resources is less reliable for the connectors than for ZFF.* Where Zotero tries but fails to download an attachment (typically a PDF file), it will display a red X in front the attachment.
![Translator pop-up for failed PDF download](./screenshots/Ubuntu-ZF-4.0.8-translator-bubble-no-pdf.png) 

As far as they are available, Zotero will also automatically add any keywords or subject terms on the translated page as tags. 

All three of these options &emdash; attaching snapshots, attaching PDFs, and associating tags &emdash; can be toggled off and on in the **General** tab of the Zotero preferences.

###Generic Translators###
While most translators are tied to specific URLs or URL patterns, Zotero has four translators that try to find items on any site. We call these "generic" translators. While they greatly extend the number of sites Zotero works on, they are somewhat less reliable and often data is of lower quality. For that reason, Zotero will always prefer a specific to a generic translator. It will then run through the generic translators in the following order

* **UnAPI** is a [tiny piece of code](http://unapi.info/) in the header of a page, that offers to serve Zotero and other reference managers with bibliographic data. While unfortunately not very common, where it is implemented (such as for the [INSPIRE database](http://inspirehep.net/?ln=en) for high energy physics) it usually provides high quality and reliable data.

* **COinS** stands for "[Context Object in Span](http://ocoins.info/)" a format in which bibliographic data can be embedded in the code of a website. COinS is a common standard for libraries and you will often find library catalogs (e.g. the Hollis Catalog of Harvard University) providing COinS data to Zotero. Another attractive feature of COinS is that it can be easily generated by Zotero. Every bibliography exported by Zotero in HTML format includes the metadata of all items embedded in COinS. COinS was developed in order to identify sources to facilitate OpenURL requests. It generally does fairly well with books - though frequently only the first of multiple authors is imported. Articles and chapters are even more problematic. 

* **DOI** stands for "[Digital Object Identifier](http://www.doi.org/)." Pretty much all recent journal articles and an increasing number of other sources published online has a DOI, which is a unique ID that identifies it online. DOIs are in a somewhat standardized format, all starting with "10.". Whenever Zotero recognizes a DOI on a page, it will look up the bibliographic data for the DOIs in a database provided by CrossRef, the principal maintainer of DOIs. Data provided by CrossRef is typically very accurate, but does not include abstracts or keywords. There is also a fair chance that the DOI translator will fail for any of three possible reasons: 1. Since the specifications for the construction of a DOI are rather lax, Zotero may mistake a chain of characters starting with 10. for a DOI; 2. The data for the DOI is not yet in the CrossRef database (this is often the case for very recent articles) and 3. The DOI is registered with a different database than CrossRef. Like IP addresses, DOIs are registered with regional organizations. While CrossRef is by far the biggest such organization, some DOIs will be registered with its Asian or European counterparts.

* **Embedded Metadata** Many academic sites embed metadata in the header of websites, mainly to facilitate searching and finding their resources. The three most common formats are [Google/Highwire](http://scholar.google.com/intl/en/scholar/inclusion.html#indexing)  tags for inclusion of resources into google scholar, [Dublin Core (DC)](http://dublincore.org/) tags, and [Prism tags](http://www.idealliance.org/specifications/prism/). Zotero will try to ready all of these and piece together the best possible information. The quality of this may very widely. In some cases, especially using google/Highwire data, results are very good, often better than DOI or COinS results and may even include PDF attachments. In other cases, metadata includes little more than the title. 

Users can tell which translator is used for any given site by hovering (without clicking) their mouse cursor over the translator icon. They will see a little black box displaying "Save to Zotero" followed by the name of the translator in parentheses: ![which translator](./screenshots/Ubuntu-ZF-3.0.11-which-translator.png). 

*ZFF only*: Often, several translators are usable on a page - e.g. a DOI as well as embedded metadata, or a dedicated translator as well as DOI. In ZFF, users can choose which of these translators Zotero uses, by right clicking on the translator icon in the URL bar. The default translator is listed at the top, i.e. DOI in this case ![translator select](./screenshots/Ubuntu-ZF-3.0.11-translator-select.png). 

##Manually Adding Items##
No one likes inputting references manually, but at times - e.g. for primary sources from an archive - this may still be necessary. Moreover, frequently items imported in Zotero may need manual touching up and it is helpful to understand manual data entry for that purpose.

To create a new item, click on the little arrow next to the green plus sign in the Zotero toolbar. ![New Item](./screenshots/Ubuntu-ZF-3.0.11-create-new-item.png) A context menu with the last five item types you have selected will appear. Under "More" at the bottom of the context menu you can select any of the item types available for Zotero (with the exception of webpage - on that see below). Once you have selected the desired item type, an empty item will appear in the right hand panel  You can then click on any field an type in data or copy&paste it, e.g. from another document. 

![An Empty Item in the Right Hand Panel](./screenshots/Ubuntu-ZF-3.0.11-empty-item.png)

###Manually Adding and Editing Creators###
Zotero uses the term **creators** to refer to all persons or institutions who contributed to the creation of a work, i.e. authors, editors, composers, painters, etc.
Personal creators should be input as Lastname, Firstname. Zotero is by default set to "two field" mode, intended for entering personal authors in Western format. For corporate authors, such as "United Nations" users should switch to "single field" by clicking on the thin white rectangle to the right of the author field ![Single Field](./screenshots/Ubuntu-ZF-3.0.11-empty-switch-single-field.png). For correct output it is important to *neither* input personal authors in single field mode, *nor* use just the Last Name field of two field mode for corporate authors.  

To add another creator, you can either click on the round plus sign ![Add Author](./screenshots/Ubuntu-ZF-3.0.11-add-author.png) next to the author field, or press Shift+Return while in the First Name field. You can change the role of a creator, e.g. from an author to an editor, by clicking on the little arrow to the left of the label "Author." ![Author Role](./screenshots/Ubuntu-ZF-4.0.8-author-role.png) Available creator roles depend on the item type. While the order in which given creator *types* are entered does not affect citations &emdash; e.g. it does not matter whether editors or authors are listed first for a chapter &emdash; the order in which creators of a given type are listed is reflected in citations. You can move a creator up or down in the list using the **Move Up** and **Move Down** options in the same menu.

**Example:** To add a chapter from an edited volume, select the item type "Book Section." Input the chapter author(s) as "Author," the book's editor(s) as "Editor." Use "Title" for the chapter title and "Book Title" for the title of the book. Include all other relevant publication information (Publisher, Place, Date, Edition, etc.).
 
![Example Entry of Creators and Titles for a Chapter from and Edited Volume](./screenshots/Ubuntu-ZF-3.0.11-chapter-example.png) 

In some cases, typically because of faulty data on a webpage, a creator's last name and first name are reversed. You can switch last and first name by right-clicking on a non-active creator.

![Swap Authors](./screenshots/Ubuntu-ZF-4.0.8-swap-authors.png)


###Some Other Tips on Manual Data Entry###
* You can use the "Tab" key to get to the next field (Shift+Tab for the previous field)
* For correct citation output in all styles, Zotero recommends storing titles in "sentence case," i.e. only capitalizing proper nouns and words at the beginning and after periods and colons. By right-clicking on a title, Zotero gives you the option to automatically convert it to pseudo sentence case. ![Transform Title](./screenshots/Ubuntu-ZF-3.0.11-transform-title.png) This conversion is rather crude and does not deal correctly with proper nouns and capitals after punctuation, but it may still safe time.
* Dates can be input in multiple formats. Zotero recognizes 1990-10-3, 10-3-1990, 10/3/1990, October 3, 1990, Oct. 3, 1990 and several other combinations. The letters "y m d" behind the date field ![YMD](./screenshots/Ubuntu-ZF-3.0.11-date-ymd.png)  indicate that Zotero recognizes all three components (Year, Month, Day) of the date, they are in the order that Zotero recognizes the date items, i.e. Oct. 3, 1990 will be followed by MDY. For dates with only a month and a year Zotero displays "y m," etc. For both the "Date" and the "Date Accessed" field Zotero, Zotero will also accept "yesterday, "today," and "tomorrow" as input and convert them automatically to the correct date.
* For several fields, including creators, Book Title/Publication, Publisher, and Place, Zotero offers auto-complete options from items in your library when you start typing.



##Importing from Bibliographic Formats##
Zotero imports from a long list of bibliographic formats:

* Zotero and Bibliontology RDF
* MARC (MAchine-Readable Cataloging) and MARC XML
* MODS (Metadata Object Description Schema)
* BibTeX
* RIS (Research Information System Format)
* Refer/BibIX
* RefWorks Tagged Format
* Citation Style Language JSON
* ISI Web of Knowledge
* NCBI Pubmed XML
* CTX (Context Object XML)
* Firefox Exported Bookmarks
* Unqualified Dublin Core RDF

*Note that the "Import" function only works for bibliographic formats, not for copies of articles, e.g. in PDF format*

Most of these import translators serve a dual purpose - they allow users to import from a given format, e.g. when transferring data from another reference manager, but they can also be "called" by web import translators. For example, most web translators importing from library catalogs will often access and import the catalog's MARC data. Here we are concerned with the former.

There are two ways to import from bibliographic formats. Both can be found under the gears icon ![Gears icon](./screenshots/gears_icon.png) in the Zotero Toolbar. To import an entire file in a bibliographic format, e.g. as exported from a reference manager, click on "Import..." ![Import](./screenshots/import_menu.png), then select the file you want to import. Zotero will import the contents into a a new collection with the timestamp of the import ![Import Collection](./screenshots/import_collection.png)  (import from Zotero RDF and Bibliontology RDF can create collections with different names). 

Zotero will try to import and store files attached to bibliographic records. For more recently developed reference managers like *Sente, Mendeley, or Quiqqa* this will work smoothly with exports in BibTeX format. For Endnote, users should use export in RIS format. Currently, it is necessary to modify the exported file to substitute the lable {internal-pdf} used by endnote with the filepath to Endnote's PDF folder. Detailed instructions are available [online](www.zotero.org/support/kb/importing_records_from_endnote).

###Importing from the Clipboard###
Alternatively, you can select one or several entries in a bibliographic format and copying them from to the clipboard (using "copy" from the edit menu or Ctrl/Cmd+C). Then, select "Import from Clipboard" from the Gears menu (see image above). When importing from clipboard, items will be added to the currently selected collection in Zotero. This may be useful to import only parts of a file, or if you see bibliographic data displayed on a website. It is crucial to copy entire records only, otherwise import will fail.

![Copying a bibtex Record to the clipboad](./screenshots/copy_import.png) 

###Direct RIS/Refer/BibTeX Import###

*ZFF only* 

Many online databases offer users the option to export citation data directly to RIS or Refer format (sometimes this option will be called "Export to Reference Manager" or "Export to Endnote"). In most such cases, Zotero will offer import via the URL bar icon as described above and users should always prefer that option. If that option is not available, however, Zotero will, by default, automatically import downloaded citation data in RIS, Refer, and BibTeX format. The first time a user downloads citation data from a page, she will be prompted by Zotero and can opt to always import such data automatically. 

![Always import RIS/Refer data from a site to Zotero](./screenshots/Ubuntu-ZF-4.0.8-ris-dialog.png)

This option, called **Use Zotero for downloaded RIS/Refer files** can be automatically disabled (and re-enabled) in the **General** tab of the Zotero preferences. ![Download RIS Option](./screenshots/Ubuntu-ZF-4.0.8-download-ris.png) 

##Adding Items by Identifier

You can quickly add items to your Zotero library using the **Add Item(s) by Identifier** button (![add by identifier](icons/toolbar-lookup.png)) at the top of the center column. Zotero can automatically create items from DOIs (for journal articles, via [CrossRef](http://www.crossref.org/)), ISBNs (for books, via the [Library of Congress](http://www.loc.gov/index.html) and [WorldCat](http://www.worldcat.org)), and PubMed IDs (for journal articles, via [NCBI PubMed](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/)).

![Adding an item using its ISBN.](screenshots/OSX-ZS-4.0.8-add-identifier.png)

There are two ways to add multiple items at once. You can enter multiple identifiers on a single line, separated by a comma or comma-space (e.g., "978-1479347711, 978-0415948739, 978-0838985892"). Alternatively, you can press `Shift + Enter` when the cursor is in the text field to expand the field. You can then copy and paste a list of identifiers into the field (one per line), and press `Shift + Enter` again or click the "Search" button. You can also directly paste a multi-line list of identifiers in the unexpanded text field.

![Batch-adding items using their ISBNs.](screenshots/OSX-ZS-4.0.8-add-identifier-batch.png)
##Retrieve Metadata for PDFs

Zotero is able to retrieve data for many PDF files. For any "top-level" PDF, i.e. for any PDF that is *not* attached to a Zotero item, Zotero can attempt to "Retrieve Metadata," in other words, find the bibliographic data online.

###Getting Ready to Retrieve Metadata
There are three ways to get PDFs into Zotero as top-level items:

1. Drag one or several files from your file system. It is possible to simply drag any file to Zotero, both to attach it, but also, as for the retrieve metadata function, at the top level. Drag the file to the middle panel. If a collection is selected, it will be placed into that collection.

2. "Store Copy of File" under the green plus sign has the exact same function as drag&drop

3. *(ZFF only)* With the PDF open in Firefox using a PDF plugin (like Adobe's Acrobat plugin or mozilla's own pdf.js) click the **Create New Item from Current Page** icon ![Create New Item Icon](./screenshots/create-new-item.png) and the PDF will stored in Zotero as a top-level item. As above, it will be placed in the selected collection.

###Retrieving Metadata
Next, right-click on the PDF and select **Retrieve Metadata for PDF** from the context menu ![Retrieve Metadata](./screenshots/retrieve-metadata.png) 

If you are doing this for the first time on Windows, Zotero will prompt you to install "pdf tools" 
&mdash; two small programs that allow Zotero to extract text from PDF files.
